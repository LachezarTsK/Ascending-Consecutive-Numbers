# Ascending-Consecutive-Numbers

Challenge at edabit.com. Tags: Algorithms, Math, Numbers, BigInteger, String


Checks whether the input string consists entirely of ascending consecutive non-negative integers.
That is to say, there must be at least two such integers so that the algorithm returns 'true'. 
Otherwise, it returns false, including for an input of a single digit.

Minimum input value: 0

Maximum input value: maximum value of BigInteger, i.e. 
[(2 to the power of Integer.MAX_VALUE) - 1].

The conditions of the challenge requre to return only 'true' or 'false' but for demonstration purposes, 
if the answer is 'true', my algorithm prints also the whole series of ascending consecutive non-negative numbers.
